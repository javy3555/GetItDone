> The overriding design goal for GetItDone started as a simple project for me to gain experience and improve my knowledge 
>in the creation of a cross plattform application using React Native, but it ended up being more than just a simple project.
>I started seeing it more as a challenge for me to create something that me or anyone else can use as their main app to 
>keep them organize both at life and work.
